         <p>Contains sexual content with focus on <b>Bimbofication</b>, including <b>degrading language</b> and erotic images in a cartoon style. This quiz uses erotically twisted stereotypes which should never be applied to real life. For entertainment purposes only. </p><br>
         <p><i> <b>Are you a bimbo</b> and want to know how others see you? Maybe you want to <b>become a bimbo</b>, and would like to know what type of you'd be? Or maybe you're just helping a bimbo who's too dumb to take this test by themselves?</i></p>
         <p><i> No matter the reason, this quiz is for you! Answer the questions and find out which one out of <b>six</b> bimbo personalities you are the most likely to be!</i></p>
         <p><i> If you don't like the results, just take the quiz again and figure out what you <b>should do</b> to be the bimbo you want to be! </i></p>

         <h3> Background </h3>
         <p> For a while I have been pondering the lack of good bimbo quizzes. I've found some, but very few are any good. So, with inspiration from Kaokatt's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kaokatt/art/QUIZ-WHO-S-YOUR-INNER-BIMBO-637238920" target="_blank"> Who's Your Inner Bimbo!?! </a> flow chart and MythicalCreatureBone's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mythicalcreaturebone/art/Eleminated-Page-1-743441041" target="_blank"> Eliminated </a> (page <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mythicalcreaturebone/art/Eliminated-Page-2-743440936" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mythicalcreaturebone/art/Eliminated-Page-3-743440562" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mythicalcreaturebone/art/Eliminated-Page-4-Part-A-743440452" target="_blank">4a</a>, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mythicalcreaturebone/art/Eliminated-Page-4-Part-B-743440280" target="_blank">4b</a>), I decided to make my own.</p>

         <p>Online quizzes are often very arbitrary, and so is this one in that I have made up what each bimbo type would be likely to answer on each question. However, aside from that, this quiz uses a proper statistical model in order to calculate the likelihood of having a particular personality. This means that as long as my assumptions on different bimbo types are reasonable, the classification will be much more accurate than your typical online quiz.</p>

         <p>Have fun!</p>

         <h3>Suggestions?</h3>
         <p>
            Do you have a suggestion for a type of bimbo that should be included? Cheerleader? Bimbo librarian?
         </p>
         <p>
            Or perhaps there is a good or fun question that you think should be included in the quiz?

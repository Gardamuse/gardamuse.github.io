Many have come to the Casino. A place of both high risk and high reward. Winners earn the wit to succeed with all their undertakings, losers gain a new purpose in life.


Choose one of several characters to play as, who to play against, and compete in a game of high stakes Texas Holdem. Win and bring your bimbofied opponents home with you, or lose, and receive the same treatment yourself."

      <p>Originally published on DeviantArt and TFGamesSite in early 2016, Bimbo Holdem Poker is something I, and several community members have worked on. My greatest thank you to all the talented artists and writers that have helped me out, and to everyone who has commented and brought lots of good feedback. For a full list of credits, software used etc. see the in-game Credits section!</p>
      <p>There are a couple of bugs in the game that won't be fixed since they likely would require a very large time-investment to fix. Yet there are tools to deal with these bugs should they arise: one is Quickmode which allows you to quickly toggle off all dialouge and AI delay, and another is Cheatmode for quickly restoring lost progress.</p>
      <p>I hope you will have fun! Welcome, to the Casino!</p>

      <h3>A quick guide to Texas Holdem Poker</h3>
      <p>
         In short, the only mechanic is betting. You bet more if you think your hand is better and less if you think your hand is worse than that of other players. A hand always has 5 cards and how good it is can be found out from this <a href="https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings">list of poker hands</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         In Texas Hold'em you first only get 2 cards and bet how good you think your hand is. Then 3 cards are added to the table for everyone to see. Now your hand consists of these 3 + the original 2 = 5 cards, and you bet again. Then another card is added so there are now 2 + 4 = 6 cards. Your hand is now the set of 5 cards (out of these 6) that is the best and you bet again. In the same way, another card is added so there are now 2 + 5 = 7 cards and your hand is again the set of 5 cards (out of these 7) that is the best. You bet a final time and all players who have not decided to stop betting show their cards and the player with the best hand wins.
      </p>
      <p>
         Raising is just that you think your hand are good and want to bet more. Folding means that you think your hand is bad and want to stop betting. Calling is the in-between where you bet just the minimum amount to stay in the game.

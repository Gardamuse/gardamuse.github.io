<!--Stereotypically, bimbos add many unnecessary words when they speak and are quite bad at spelling. Mispell is a web app that lets you transform any text into something that a bimbo might have written.-->

      <h2> Mispell 1.1 - Bimbo Speak Translator </h2>
      <p> Acting dumb in the right way can be difficult. Mispell allows you to easily <b>read or write like a bimbo</b> by translating whatever text you give it to sound dumber. How much dumber the text will sound can be adjusted with a slider, allowing you to tune the text to your preferences or stage of bimbofication. </p>
      <p> Be wary though, go too stupid and some words may be changed entirely, not to mention the poor grasp a bimbo might have on any number past 10.</p>
      <p> Mispell is inspired by DeviantArtist MimiDumb's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mimidumb/art/Bimbo-at-computer-bimbofication-guide-727964056"> Bimbo at computer</a> bimbofication guide were the idea is that reading text with various errors will put the reader in a bimbo mindset, both by slowing down reading speed and by setting up for a bimbo-like inner monologue.</p>

      <h2 id="iqDisplay">IQ: 140</h2>
      <p>Adjust how dumb the text will sound. The lower the IQ, the more misspells and unnecessary words are added. At maximum IQ, there will be no change in the text.</p>

      <h3> New in Version 1.1 </h3>
      <p> This version brings an overhauled insertion algorithm, less generic misspellings in favour of targeted rules for specific sounds and a new number scrambling feature. Who thought bimbos could count past 10? </p>

      <h3> In addition...</h3>
      <p> This app is free to use for any purpose. If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free write a comment or contact me directly. I would be especially grateful for dumber-sounding synonyms to more difficult words. </p>
      <p> Besides use through this website, Mispell is a JS library that can allow apps or games to tweak text to conform to a dynamically chosen level of bimbofication. It is available under the MIT license and you can find it on the <a href="https://github.com/Gardamuse/mispell">Mispell Github page</a>.</p>

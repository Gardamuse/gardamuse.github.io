<!--Stereotypically, bimbos add many unnecessary words when they speak and are quite bad at spelling. Mispell is a web app that lets you transform any text into something that a bimbo might have written.-->

      <h2> Mispell 1.1 - Bimbo Speak Translator </h2>
      <p> Acting dumb in the right way can be difficult. Mispell makes it easy to <b>read or write like a bimbo</b> by translating text to sound dumber, and make it harder to understand. How much can be adjusted with a slider, allowing you to tune the text to your stage of bimbofication. </p>
      <p> Be wary though, go too dumb and some words may be changed entirely, not to mention the poor grasp a bimbo might have on any number past 10.</p>

     <h2>Browser Addon</h2>
     <p>Mispell is available as a browser addon for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/mispell/mispell_addon.xpi">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mispell/bpfbniiojcnhefjjdkldgopkmniambgb" target="_blank">Chrome</a>.</p>

     <p>While active, the addon will modify all text on websites you visit. Either bimbofying it for a more fun reading experience, or scrambling it to help you not understand difficult words. All settings can be adjusted from the addon menu.</p>
     <p>I've opted to self-distribute the addon for Firefox (so no store page), and keep it unlisted on Chrome (you can only find it if you have the link). Both browsers should auto-update the addon when a new version is released, but I haven't tested that.</p>

     <h3>Before installing!</h3>
     <p>Beware that while the addon is active, websites will take longer to load, some websites may not behave correctly, and the addon may interfere when you type on certain websites. This is because the addon can have difficulty discerning what text it should not edit.</p>

     <p>The addon can be quickly turned off by setting the "IQ" slider to its maximum value. This makes it is easy to turn it on again later by just lowering the slider. Otherwise, when you're tired of the addon, or if you experience problems, simply uninstall or disable it, and refresh the page.</p>

      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p> Just want to try Mispell out on some text? Do it here! The results can vary somewhat from the browser extension. </p>
      <h3>Input Text</h3>
      <p> Write or paste some text in the box below! </p>
      <textarea id="terminal" class="terminal" rows="10" cols="1000" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;" /></textarea>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="iqDisplay">IQ: 140</h3>
      <p>Adjust how dumb the text will sound. The lower the IQ, the more misspells and unnecessary words are added. At maximum IQ, there will be no change in the text.</p>
      <span style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 2em;">
         <button type="button" class="pink-button" style="margin-right: 1em; font-size: 1em;" onclick="addToSlider(-10)">-10 IQ</button>

      <p> Press <b>Bimbofy</b> to make the text sound like a Bimbo wrote it!</p>
      <p> Press <b>Scramble</b> to get the bimbo reading experience: uncommon and long words will be difficult to understand.</p>
      <button type="button" class="pink-button" style="margin-bottom: 1em;" onclick="bimbofyButton(event)">Bimbofy</button>

     <h3>Inspiration</h3>
     <p> Mispell was inspired by DeviantArtist MimiDumb's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mimidumb/art/Bimbo-at-computer-bimbofication-guide-727964056"> Bimbo at computer</a> bimbofication guide were the idea is that reading text with errors puts the reader in a bimbo mindset by slowing down reading speed and setting up a bimbo-like inner monologue.</p>

      <h2> Mispell - a Bimbo Speak Translator </h2>
      <p> Acting dumb in the right way can be difficult. Mispell allows you to easily <b>read or write like a bimbo</b> by translating whatever text you give it to sound dumber. How much dumber the text will sound can be adjusted with a slider which allows you to tune the text to your preferences or modify it for different stages of a bimbofication.</p>
      <p> Mispell is inspired by DeviantArtist MimiDumb's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mimidumb/art/Bimbo-at-computer-bimbofication-guide-727964056"> Bimbo at computer</a> bimbofication guide were the idea is that reading text with various errors will put the reader in a bimbo mindset, both by slowing down reading speed and by setting up for a bimbo-like inner monologue.</p>

      <h3> In addition...</h3>
      <p> This app is free to use for any purpose. If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free write a comment or contact me directly. I would be especially grateful for dumber-sounding synonyms to more difficult words. </p>
      <p> Besides use through this website, Mispell is a JS library that can allow apps or games to tweak text to conform to a dynamically chosen level of bimbofication. Any devs who are interested may contact me for access to the library itself since I have not yet made it publicly available.</p>

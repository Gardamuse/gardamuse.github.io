<p> A small AutoHotkey script that queues random sound files from a set of your choosing each time a hotkey is pressed. Sounds are played back until the queue is empty. </p>

<p> After downloading and extracting the zip file, place all the sounds you want to use in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sounds</code> folder next to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ahk</code> file. Start the script by double-clicking.
   Use <b> Alt+Q </b> to play one sound and <b>Alt+W</b> to play ten. </p>

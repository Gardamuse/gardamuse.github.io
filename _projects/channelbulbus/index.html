         <h2>ChannelBulbus</h2>
         <p>The two videos on this page were created by the youtube channel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090916000636/http://www.youtube.com/user/ChannelBulbus" target="_blank">ChannelBulbus</a> in 2008. Unfortunately the original videos seems to have been removed by youtube in 2019. In addition, despite having kept my eye out for the artist for over a decade now, I've never found any more of ChannelBulbus' work or any trace of what they are doing now.</p>
         <p>Channebulbus is in some sense a hero of mine, and these two videos are what made me search out the breast expansion art community in the first place. Therefore, and because it would be a shame to have such excellent videos dissappear, I've decided to host them here for the time being.</p>
         <p>ChannelBulbus, wherever you are, I hope you are doing well!</p>

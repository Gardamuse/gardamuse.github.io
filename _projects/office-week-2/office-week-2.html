Play as Katherine, an ambitious new hire for Bimnocorp. Can you stay in control long enough to become president of the company, or will you succumb to your libido long before?


A game best enjoyed by immersing yourself in the role of Katherine. Simply pressing buttons may not be as much fun."

         <h2>Office Week 2.2: Inflated Prices</h2>
         <p>Contains sexual content with focus on <b>Bimbofication</b>. This includes <b>Breast Expansion</b>, <b>TF/TG</b> and <b>TF/Ment</b>. </p>

         <p>You play as Katherine, the new Bimnocorp employee. The game mechanics are, as in the previous game, inspired by common bimbo transformation tropes, but are a bit different from before. Working grants you more money the more IQ you have, but nothing else. Having sex lowers your IQ, which in turn turns you into more of a bimbo, but to have sex you need to be atleast a bit horny and the more horny you are when you have sex, the more IQ you will lose. Your current level of hornyness is displayed right next to your IQ. Hornyness is gained each day, and is gained faster the bigger your "assets" are, the lower your IQ is, the longer you have been working at Bimnocorp and on how many times you have gone to the hypnotist. On top of this, you get better at having sex the more times you have it, and this level is displayed below your IQ. If you are good enough, you can even start making money of off it. You can still only have sex if you're in the mood, though.</p>

         <p>There is also a shop menu displayed on screen. Here you can buy silicone injections and ass growth potions (couldn't come up with a better name) which will increase the size of your breasts and butt, but won't change your IQ. The maximum amount of these things you can buy however, is more limited the higher your IQ is. You can also go for a hypnosis session which will, probably, make you much less horny, but increase of fast you get horny again. You can also buy a lifetime supply of stockings, which will allow you to wear stockings. Having bought this will increase the amount of money you gain from having sex, but wearing them is up to personal preference.</p>

         <p> There are then four additional displays. The first one shows a picture of Katherine, the second displays what Katherine calls herself, the third one shows her current position in the company and the fourth and bottom-most field will display messages depending on what you are doing, somewhat narrating your progress. Currently it only tells you about what you just did, but this might be extended to include short paragraphs describing certain events, when you reach a certain sex level, for example. </p>

         <p> Finally there is also weight meter. One can change between metric and imperial using the button for this to the right. The weight value however, has currently no impact on gameplay, and is only determined by all other effects influencing how big Katherine is. Oh, and there is also a restart button. </p>

         <h3> Background </h3>
         <p>As the list of features I wanted to add to Office Week grew larger, I decided to instead of upgrading the first game, write most things up again from scratch. This new version features dynamic colors for all animations (i.e. the game can set them, although there is no way for players to do so as of release). And while the first game basically scrolled back and fourth through a single animation spritesheet, this version uses several spritesheets, one for each part of the body, so that they can change independently of eachother. On top of this, several features have been added to the point I would say that this is actually a game now, and just not an interactive animation. More on the gameplay and updated ui below.</p>

         <h3>Game not showing?</h3>
         <p>
            If the game is not showing it probably means that you don't have flash installed, or your browser doesn't support it. If this happens you can try another browser, or <a href="/projects/office-week-2/OfficeWeek2.swf">download</a> the game and play it in a standalone flash player. (If you don't have a standalone flash player, you will need to install one.)

In the bimbofication booth you can watch a variety of characters transforming into cute, cotton-candy-brained bimbos!"

         <h2>Bimbofication Booth</h2>
         <p>Contains sexual content with focus on <b>Bimbofication</b>. This includes <b>Breast Expansion</b>, <b>TF/TG</b> and <b>TF/Ment</b>. </p>

         <p>I have always enjoyed transformation sequences, but I've never really been a fan of looking at huge spritesheets. Comics can be alright, but even there it can be annoying to scroll around the page. That's why I've made this webapp to allow for watching bimbofication in comfort.</p>

         <p> Here you'll find a collection of characters, many that I have previously posted on DeviantArt, but also entirely new characters! Who is your favorite? </p>

         <h2>NEWEST CHARACTER </h2>
         <h3>Angela</h3>
         <p>
            Earth is not a place where the powers of heaven and hell battle for supremacy, no, that is our own invention. Earth is more like an aquarium, where gods of both old and new simply enjoy watching us, to test us not for a purpose, but for their own enjoyment. And what can be more entertaining than to watch a woman ascend to an immortal life of pleasure?

         <p> One of my old sequences from DeviantArt that I had not put here since it requires starting in the middle of the sequence. You can go left to transform Angela to the dark side, or right to let her ascend towards heaven. Which path do you prefer?</p>

         <h2> Improvements </h2>
         <p> While the app has been working well for me, there are plenty of devices and browser I can't test extensively on my own. So let me know if you encounter any bugs or if something is performing poorly, but be sure to tell me what device/browser you are using! </p>
         <p> I hope to improve on the bimbofication booth, although I make no promises! However, if you have a good idea for a feature you'd want, feel free to tell me in the comments! </p>
         <p> If you want to submit a character of your own, checkout the <a href="/character-submission/"> character submission instructions</a>.</p>

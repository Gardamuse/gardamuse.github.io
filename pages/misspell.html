      <h2> Mispell - a Bimbo Speak Translator </h2>
      <p> Acting dumb in the right way can be difficult. Mispell allows you to easily <b>read or write like a bimbo</b> by translating whatever text you give it to sound dumber. How much dumber the text will sound can be adjusted with a slider which allows you to tune the text to your preferences or modify it for different stages of a bimbofication.</p>
      <p> Mispell is inspired by DeviantArtist MimiDumb's <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mimidumb/art/Bimbo-at-computer-bimbofication-guide-727964056"> Bimbo at computer</a> bimbofication guide were the idea is that reading text with various errors will put the reader in a bimbo mindset, both by slowing down reading speed and by setting up for a bimbo-like inner monologue.</p>

      <h2>Input Text</h2>
      <p> Write or paste some text in the box below! </p>
      <textarea id="terminal" class="terminal" rows="10" cols="1000" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;" /></textarea>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="iqDisplay">IQ: 140</h2>
      <p>Drag the slider to adjust how dumb the text will sound. The lower the IQ, the more misspells and unnecessary words are added. At maximum IQ, there will be no change in the text.</p>
      <input type="range" name="points" min="0" max="100" value="100" id="slider" class="pink-slider" oninput="updateSlider(event)" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
      <p> Press the button to make the text sound dumber! </p>
      <button type="button" class="pink-button" style="margin-bottom: 1em;" onclick="bimbofyButton(event)">Bimbofy</button>

      <h3> In addition...</h3>
      <p> This app is free to use for any purpose. If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free write a comment or contact me directly. I would be especially grateful for dumber-sounding synonyms to more difficult words. </p>
      <p> Besides use through this website, Mispell is a JS library that can allow apps or games to tweak text to conform to a dynamically chosen level of bimbofication. Any devs who are interested may contact me for access to the library itself since I have not yet made it publicly available.</p>

    <p>Originally published on DeviantArt and TFGamesSite in early 2016, Bimbo Holdem Poker is something I, and several community members have worked on. My greatest thank you to all the talented artists and writers that have helped me out, and to everyone who has commented and brought lots of good feedback. For a full list of credits, software used etc. see the in-game Credits section!</p>
    <p>There are a couple of bugs in the game that won't be fixed since they likely would require a very large time-investment to fix. Yet there are tools to deal with these bugs should they arise: one is Quickmode which allows you to quickly toggle off all dialouge and AI delay, and another is Cheatmode for quickly restoring lost progress.</p>
    <p>I hope you will have fun! Welcome, to the Casino!</p>

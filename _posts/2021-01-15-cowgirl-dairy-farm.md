As always, it turned into a longer project than I anticipated, but version 1.0 of [**Cowgirl Dairy Farm**](/play/cowgirl-dairy-farm/) is out now! Check it out if you haven't already!

The game may still be a bit messy. Mechanics and effects are not as visible to the player as I think they should be, and the content quantity is on the lower side for some things. I'm thinking especially of the character art that is currently shared by all cowgirls. However, I've spent enough time on this that I'm once again starting to feel that I need feedback to know which things is actually worth focusing on. So, release it is, and do let me know what you think in the comments!

Looking forwards, I'm still quite happy with where this game is right now, and whether I continue any major development depends a bit on how everyone likes it. I think it's kinda fun now, but I also reckon it might not be for everyone. In any case, I plan to take a bit of a break from this game first, except for critical bug fixes or small tweaks, and look into another shorter project that I think could be very fun.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the beta test back in November! The game would have been much less interesting had it not been for your feedback. Many thanks also to those of you who support this and all my other projects on Patreon! It is much appreciated :)


Have fun!

Because DeviantArt is not the ideal place for games, be them NSFW or otherwise, I felt like I could probably use my own website. By the advice of a friend I looked into finding a good solution for that. Thus, here we are.

The idea is that my work will be accessible from here. While not much yet, [Bimbo Holdem Poker][bhp] is already hosted here. Click that link, or access it from the navigation bar.

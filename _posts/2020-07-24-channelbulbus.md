I was recently made aware that one of my heroes of erotic art, ChannelBulbus, recently seems to have been removed from YouTube, along with all of their videos. ChannelBulbus was the one who inspired me to search out the breast expansion art community in the first place, and those videos are the core inspiration for almost everything I've done since.

Unfortunately, despite having kept my eyes open for ChannelBulbus for over a decade now, I have not found any trace of this brilliant creator.

Needless to say, I think it'd be a shame to see those videos disappear. Luckily I had already archived two of that channels three videos, and I will be hosting them [here](/play/channelbulbus) for the time being.

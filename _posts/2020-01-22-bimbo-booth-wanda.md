The holidays may be over, but that doesn't mean we can't have some holiday cheer. [CraftTG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Cn3RZ3IDgkFBye-5Ejgvw) has created another transformation sequence for the **[Bimbofication Booth](/bimbo-booth/)**, involving three characters out for a winter walk. Expect more clothes than usual, but some quite wholesome holiday transformations!

Many thanks to CraftTG!

Enjoy!

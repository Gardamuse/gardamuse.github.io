Today I'm releasing the [**Bimbo Personality Quiz**](/play/bimbo-personality-quiz)! I have for a while tried finding similar quizzes online, but with the exception of Kaokatt's [Who's Your Inner Bimbo!?!](https://www.deviantart.com/kaokatt/art/QUIZ-WHO-S-YOUR-INNER-BIMBO-637238920){:target="blank"}, I really haven't found any good ones. So I decided to make my own!

For now there are six different types, but I won't spoil them for you here. My intention is that you can take the quiz several times using different approaches, like trying to fill it in for a character from somewhere else, so that you can explore all the types. There is also quite a lot of room for adding more content to the quiz, so if you have any suggestions like particular bimbo types or questions you'd like to see added, feel free to comment!

I have also published a [**Patreon page**](https://www.patreon.com/gardamuse)! I have been asked a couple of times in the past if there is anywhere to support me, but I have hesitated to set anything up since I produce content on a quite irregular schedule. That hasn't changed, but my thinking is that if you want to support me and Blushing Defeat as is, I'd be grateful for the help in maintaining the site!

Patrons get access to a patron-only Discord channel, and for anyone supporting at 5$ or more, I've also added a compilation of profile pictures for most of my characters, just to give you something extra for being so generous.

So, if you are interested, head over there and check it out! If not, that is fine and Blushing Defeat will continue being for free :)

I've released an update to [**Cowgirl Dairy Farm**](/play/cowgirl-dairy-farm/), v1.1 Milk Market. This update brings one new character, and several palette swaps for both characters. It also adds the aforementioned milk market system, to add more gameplay to managing your milk supply and selling.

Balance is still a bit off, especially in the late game. There are just too many stats and mechanics for me to properly balance just by playing for a while. That said, I believe v1.1 should address many of the issues that was raised in v1.0. So I'm looking forward to further feedback!

A while ago I was chatting in the comments by [CraftTG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Cn3RZ3IDgkFBye-5Ejgvw) who was eager to create a character for the Bimbo Booth. After some amazing work, I am now happy to welcome Chloe to the **[Bimbofication Booth](/bimbo-booth/)**! She is a bit jealous of how her friends always gets all the attention, but fortunately, your favourite shady corporation is there to help.

With this update, I am also removing the old Character Viewer since all of its characters and features with upgrades are available in the Bimbofication Booth.

Enjoy, and many thanks to CraftTG â™¥

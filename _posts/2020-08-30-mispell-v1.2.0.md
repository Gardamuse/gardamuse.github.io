I've released version 1.2 of the [**Mispell Bimbo Translator**](/mispell/). This brings a new feature "Simplify" that allows you to try the bimbo reading experience. In this mode, text is changed so that the longer and more uncommon a word is, the more it will be scrambled, emulating how reading might be for a bimbo.

This is the first version of this feature, so needless to say there are improvements that can be made. In particular, it's effects have not been balanced to "accurately" follow the IQ scale that is used on the slider.

In other news, if you follow me on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/gardamuse) you will have seen that I've published a few artworks recently. It's been quite fun to do a bit of drawing for a change, but I haven't really had the time to upload them here yet. I plan to do so, but I want to have a decent gallery functionality before I do. So for now, those will be on DeviantArt.

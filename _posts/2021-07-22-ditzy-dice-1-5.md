Version 1.5 of [**Ditzy Dice**](/play/ditzy-dice/) has been released. The big new feature is modding support. This means you can create your own cards and endings. There currently aren't any mods to download, but if you make one, feel free to get in touch!

With this update, I plan to take a break from adding any major features to Ditzy Dice for a while. There are still going to be a few minor things and bugs to fix, but there are a few other projects I want to look into as well.

Finally, as usual, many thanks to Duhad for helping me write for the new cards!

Have fun!

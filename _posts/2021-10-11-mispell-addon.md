Some of you may have tried out [**Mispell**](/mispell/) once or twice. Well, it is now a browser addon for Firefox and Chrome!

It was always my intention to make it into an addon, and it is actually quite fun to use. It's able to apply to a lot of dynamic content as well, like Twitter, or even if you're using the Discord web client.

It does come with a few drawbacks though, mainly that websites will load slower and that it can sometimes interfere when you type on certain websites. However, it is quick to turn the addon off if you just slide the IQ to its max value, then it won't affect your browsing at all until you turn it on again.

[Check it out](/mispell/), and have fun!

Version 1.3 of [**Ditzy Dice**](/play/ditzy-dice/) is out now, adding 10 epilogues with player choices for a total of 24 possible endings!

This update also brings some new game mechanics, mana, and abilities to spend that mana on. Because some people complained about dice rolling the same result, they are now much _more_ likely to roll the same result (as likely as real dice would be)! However, rolling the same result on multiple dice now feeds into the rest of the game mechanics properly, rather than just being a boring outcome.

Many thanks again to Duhad, this time for helping me write all the epilogues!

There are a few other small changes and improvements as well, and if you want more details, check them out in the in-game Patch Notes menu.

As always, if you have any feedback, feel free to get in touch or tell me in the comments!

Have fun!

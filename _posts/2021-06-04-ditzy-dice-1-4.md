It's been a busy month for me, and it's not over yet, but for various reasons I thought it would be best to release version 1.4 of [**Ditzy Dice**](/play/ditzy-dice/) now. This update brings several new cards, updated illustrations (one card by Kobi-Tfs!) and endings are now unlocked once you get them, and you can see all your unlocked endings on the Collection screen. Oh, and epilogues can now have hidden dialogue options, that are only available if you have certain cards, but I haven't been able to add too many of those yet.

Many thanks to Duhad for helping me a great deal with writing cards, and to [Kobi-Tfs](https://www.deviantart.com/kobi-tfs) for the new Intelligence card art!

Have fun!

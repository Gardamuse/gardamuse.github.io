I've released update 1.2 of [**Ditzy Dice**](/play/ditzy-dice/)!

This update brings additional descriptions for each card that you will be able to see once you activate the card after each round. These descriptions sometimes describe the transformation as it is happening, and sometimes give other kinds of context like how the player character reacts to it. Many thanks to Duhad for helping me write all of these!

There is now also a settings menu where you can set filters to remove types of content you don't want to see. Something like this has been requested by a lot of people, and this solution means that you can be sure to avoid most of the TF content you really don't like, while still being in the risk zone of getting the "bad" cards that are actually really hot when you do get, like heavy brain drain.

That said I am looking to add more player decision as well, but I want to make sure it is in a way that doesn't decrease the likelihood of those really hot bad ends, while still increasing your ability to shape the outcome. This is something for future updates though.

However, what is also in this update is a new "chat" system, that makes it clear who is saying what and makes it much easier to give the player some dialogue options. This will be particularly useful for creating more of an actual epilogue later on.

If you want more details on this update, they're in the game's Patch Notes section.

Have fun!

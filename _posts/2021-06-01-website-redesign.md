It's been almost three years since my first blog post on Blushing Defeat, and 1 year since I opened up the patreon, so I thought it was high time for a couple of upgrades to the site! The menu has been moved up, all menu items are now folded into a hamburger menu on mobile and I've redesigned the front page to make it look a little bit more modern.

Modern web design incorporates a lot of scrolling even on large screens, which I'm not too big a fan of, but this is usually done to split longs texts into shorter, more manageable chunks, which I do like. I think I reached a good middle-ground for the front page.

I have some thoughts on bringing the blog, apps and gallery sections more in line with the front page style as well, but I think its good enough as it is for now. If you find any bugs in the new design, or something isn't working, let me know!

Just to mention it, Ditzy Dice 1.4 is coming along as well, bringing a bunch of new cards and improvements. I hope to finish the update quite soon, but it's difficult to know exactly how long that will take.

Cheers!

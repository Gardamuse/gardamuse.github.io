I often save images to my private collection, but don't get around to viewing them that often. Sometimes it can be nice to start a slideshow, but I've never really found the right playback speed. The solution? Play at a fast speed, but display many images at once, and only replace a few of them at a time.

Introducing the [**Auto Collagery**](/auto-collagery/)! Add some images from your private collection, adjust the image grid size and playback speed, and press play! By adding more images than can be shown on your screen at once, there will be less chance of showing the same image twice at the same time.

Hopefully you can have some fun with this :)

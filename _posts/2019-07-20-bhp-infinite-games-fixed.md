A long standing Bimbo Holdem Poker bug that I had never been able to fix occurred in quite long games. This bug sometimes made the game not end, and instead allowed players that had already lost keep betting.

The cause, and a fix for this bug, was recently pointed out to me by MaddieMeadows! Many thanks to her for that!

That fix is now implemented in version 1.2.4 of Bimbo Holdem Poker, [available now](/bimbo-holdem-poker/).

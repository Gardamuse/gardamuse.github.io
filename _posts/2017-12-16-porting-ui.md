A large part of the time I spent on Bimbo Holdem Poker was devoted to creating a good UI system. Buttons, sliders and other components had to be easy to add with code, work well within the game, and look decent. I've now begun porting some of that functionality to Java. So far I'm using JavaFX, which comes with many upsides, but also some downsides when it comes to implementing complex behaviour.

Does this mean I will be porting Bimbo Holdem Poker to Java? So far, I don't know. This is a required step for doing so, but I may just use this system for something else, or nothing at all.

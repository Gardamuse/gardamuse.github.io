Bimbo's are easy to use and always care about looking good, and so should websites! Joking aside, I've given Blushing Defeat a few improvements to look more interesting and provide a smoother user experience. Most importantly, the [Apps and Games](/play/) page have received a good 300cc of upgrades so that it should now be much easier to browse. The old design really wasn't very good.

In other news, Mispell have also received some updates during the last month, both in design and under the hood. I don't really have any patch notes ready, but it should be possible to notice a different feel from what it was on release.

Enjoy!

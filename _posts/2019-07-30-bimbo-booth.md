Blushing Defeat have for quite some time had the Character Viewer which has allowed watching transformations of five Bimbo Holdem Poker characters. It does work on all devices, but not that well.

However, I really like the idea of a web app for viewing transformation sequences. As such I'm proud to announce version 1 of the **[Bimbofication Booth](/bimbo-booth/)**!

It has all characters of the old Character Viewer as well as three new ones. Two I have previously published on DeviantArt but the last character, William, is an all-new and about to undergo some drastic changes.

UPDATE 31/7: Now with even more characters and additional status information!

This has been a quite different development experience to what's usual for me. Most of my time has been spent writing and drawing rather than coding, and Ditzy Dice so far technically has a lot more content, but is also much shorter, than for instance Cowgirl Dairy Farm. It's a good feeling though, because I think this is a good base to build more on.

I haven't done all the drawing myself though. Instead I have been able to get permission from a few of my favourite artists to use some of their art as card illustrations. Many thanks therefore to **CrazyCowProductions**, **Blackshirtboy**, **Luxu** and **Bradtanker3**, as well as to those who had previously commissioned art from them and also allowed me to use it.

I also want to thank some of the people whose work inspired me to create Ditzy Dice. First and foremost **Xsentius** for their Bimbo Dice caption series, **MythicalCreatureBone** for their Eliminated choose-your-own-adventure and finally **GrapplerOfBooty** for their Transoria sheets and MTG card series.

If you want to check out their work for yourselves, which I recommend, see the full list of credits and links to everyone in the Ditzy Dice credits section.

Finally, a big thank you to everyone who supports Blushing Defeat on Patreon for making this possible.

Have fun!

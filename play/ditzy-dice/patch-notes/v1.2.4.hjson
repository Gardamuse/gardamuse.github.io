# Fixes
    * Player chat messages are no longer gigantic. This was caused by a css conflict between the game and the website.
    * Cards that use the default transformation description no longer freeze the game after being activated when they are the only card picked that round.
    * Fixed that subcards were not being filtered out in the game, only on the collection screen.

    <h2>Erotic Games</h2>
    <p>This site is about erotic games and other <b>sexual content</b> with a focus on transformation, notably <b>bimbofication</b> and <b>breast expansion</b>. If you do not wish to view, or are legally allowed to view such content, please leave now.</p>

    <h2>Sexual Content</h2>
    <p>Be also aware that this is a sexual fetish that amongst other things can involve degrading speech, ideas and stereotypes about gender and intelligence. I want to underline here that all such concepts are purely fetish fantasy and have no place in the real world. Everything on this site, including my blog, is created on the basis that everyone who visits understands that concept, and are here to enjoy themselves nonetheless. So again, if you are not comfortable with any of this, I urge you to not browse any further, since in that case, this site is not for you.</p>

        <h3>Hey, I'm Gardamuse!</h3>
        <p>I used to publish my work on <a href="http://gardamuse.deviantart.com" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a> and <a href="https://www.tfgamessite.com/index.php?module=viewgame&id=839" target="_blank">TFGamesSite</a>, where you might have seen it before</p>

        <p> Due to various restrictions on those sites I decided to launch Blushing Defeat as a place to collect most my work. As such, here you will be able to find most of what I make, ranging from erotic art and transformation sequences to fully fledged games.</p>

    <h2>Purely Fantasy</h2>
    <p>Fetish fantasy often involves scenarios that are hot to think about, but which have no place in the real world, and would be truly terrible in reality. Everything on this site is presented on the basis that everyone understands that, and that you are here to enjoy yourself nonetheless.</p>

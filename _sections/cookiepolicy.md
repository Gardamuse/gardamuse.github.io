Should you wish to opt out of having cookies placed on your device you can disable cookies in your browser settings.

I, Gardamuse, certainly care about data privacy and I would not have unnecessary data collected, especially as this is a site that you might want to browse discretely. Yet I find the cookie policy notice very annoying, both as a consumer and a producer. The pop-up is both obtrusive for the user, and seems ineffective at actually protecting your data, but I am required by EU law to show it. Much better would be if browsers automatically allowed or disallowed cookies, depending on user preferences, supported by a simple invisible html tag containing cookie information on each page, but I digress. If you have any questions, you may contact me via [gardamuse@blushingdefeat.com](mailto:gardamuse@blushingdefeat.com).
